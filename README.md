# Work.Day.Scheduler

## Description
I created a work day scheduler. When you open the website, the header includes the current day and date. Below it, timeblocks from 9am to 5pm are shown. They are color coordinated based on the time of day, past hour being gray, current hour being red, and future hour being green. When clicking within the time block, text can be added to it to plan an event for that specific hour. When the save button is clicked, the text is saved into local storage so that if you close the window the text area is saved. If you refresh or return to the page, the text area will be still shown.
